# This is used to control bootstrap, which partially generated this repository.
# Pretty soon this will be generated by a tool called "stencil", the open source
# version of bootstrap. See: https://github.com/getoutreach/stencil. This has been
# written to be compatible with that, but at the time it wasn't completely
# ready to be used, so the fork tritonmedia/bootstraper was used instead, but
# modified to use the open source components that stencil will use. Please excuse the
# mess.
